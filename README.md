- 👋 Hi, I’m @scatterplotsandtea
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics and data visualization
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in SQL and R, and learning python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on social science projects that could be used by journalists or the general public to shed light on an issue facing our society
- 📫 How to reach me ... www.ScatterplotsAndTea.com 
- 💡 I'm inspired by Helen Wall, Bill Shander, Eric Balash, and Dr. William Lopez' "2022 Oscar Outfits as Public Health Graphs"
